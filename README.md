# Recipe-Healthiness-Score-Detalytics

## Project Description
Detalytics' project is about Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) and Natural language processing (NLP). One simplified version of this project consists on the next steps:

1. Study the Food Compass score and explore a database of about 8,000 food items for which this score has been calculated.

2. Explore a database of 50,000 recipes (ingredients and cooking procedure).

3. Develop a MCDM procedure to score a representative sample of 500 recipes, such  that it takes into account the Food Compass score definition and "generalizes" it in a coherent manner. The rationale explaining this MCDM procedure and its consistency with the Compass score should be thoroughly documented.  

4. Develop a NLP method to process these recipes (as text input data)  and extract relevant features and information that can then be used to calculate the score for the 45,500 remaining recipes. Here, you could potentially need to train neural networks to achieve this. Again this step should be thoroughly documented (feature engineering, model choices, training procedure, etc.).

Step 3 and 4 could be developed at the same time, depending on type of model you decide to work with.
